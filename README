This is an easily maintained table logging system for PostgreSQL. It removes
the need for manual administration of triggers on individual tables, instead
wrapping maintenance of the tables, triggers, and indexes on the logging tables
into a single function.

The system supports excluding specific trigger events from the log, as well as
pruning tables based on a timeframe and size. (See logging.prune.sql and
logging.prune_size.sql)

There are a number of other functions included that may or may not work at
this time.

Consult the INSTALL file for installing to your database. 

The system also supports multiple table logs. See INSTALL for configuration of
these.
